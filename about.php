  <h2 class="green">Style</h2>
This book was made to be fun, helpful, and student focused. As such, primary content here was (and still is) populated with the help of students. <u class="black">No exceptions.</u><br><br>

  Most math books out there are boring and hard to read!  If you found yourself here, you will ideally find the ways this is written to be both insightful and engaging. You may even catch yourself laughing while browsing around: there is a joke section, after all! <br><br>

  <h2 class="blue">Development</h2>
While we currently offer a limited number of subjects, the library is constantly expanding with new topics, ideas, and (eventually) new subjects! <br><br> Feel free to jump in using the comments section in any particular lesson, or in our <a href="contact.php">Contact Page</a>
<br><br>We <u class="pink">love</u> contribution, and hope you will enjoy the culmination of what this library has to offer!
